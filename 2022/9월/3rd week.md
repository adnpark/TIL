### Sep 20~22

- so busy preparing for new release of cosmo app
- learned how to deal with real time issues including bug, error, and etc.
- actually, it was first time for me to launch new features to massive users.
- realized that QA process is way much more important than I thought, and I must get used to deal with a lot of real-time errors.
