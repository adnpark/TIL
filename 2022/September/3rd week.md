# 3rd Week, September

### Summary

- A tough week overall.
- Although I got stressed so much, I learned many precious lessons.
- I think it'd be better to stop thinking that I have to do well, I have to be better than it. These thoughts affect me as poison.
- Just let everything go and simply do. Don't need to be perfect. It's ok to do sucks. In fact, everything is fine.

### Monday Sep 19

- Learned differences between maxFeePerGas and maxPriorityFeePerGas. EIP 1559.

### Sep 20~22

- So busy preparing for new release
- Learned how to deal with real time issues including bug, error, and etc.
- Actually, it was first time for me to launch new features to massive users.
- Realized that QA process is way much more important than I expected, and I must get used to fix live errors.

### Sep 23

- Reminded that constructor code is not included in runtime bytecode. In other words, constructor function does not affect extcodesize of contract.
- Learned how to anticipate contract address from account address and nonce. Don't forget create2 btw.

### Sep 24~25

- Struggled with bugs, errors, and all kinds of technical issues.
- It was a tough day. I've felt huge pressure in the whole time.
- However, I learned lots of lessons from it.
  - Bugs are everywhere, even now.
  - When I audit codes, I must have a mindset that definitely there will be bugs in codes written by me or my colleagues.
  - In contrast, if someone finds critical bugs in a live product, it is not a problem of the developer who wrote the codes, but the team and process itself.
  - Don't need to blame yourself or your colleagues for the live bugs. It seems hard to stop blaming yourself, but it's the truth. It's not your fault.
  - Better to be more imaginative when writing test cases.
  - "The more the better" is always true for writing test cases.
