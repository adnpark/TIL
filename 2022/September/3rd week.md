# 3rd Week, September

### Monday Sep 19

- learned differences between maxFeePerGas and maxPriorityFeePerGas. EIP 1559.

### Sep 20~22

- so busy preparing for new release of cosmo app
- learned how to deal with real time issues including bug, error, and etc.
- actually, it was first time for me to launch new features to massive users.
- realized that QA process is way much more important than I thought, and I must get used to deal with a lot of real-time errors.

### Sep 23

- reminded that constructor code is not included in runtime bytecode. In other words, constructor function does not affect extcodesize of contract.
- learned how to anticipate contract address from account address and nonce.

### Sep 24~25

- Struggled with bugs, errors, and all kinds of technical issues.
- It was tough days. I've felt hugh pressure for whole time.
- However, I learned lots of lessons from it.
  - Bugs are everywhere, even in now.
  - When I audit codes, I must have a mindset that there will be bugs in codes written by me or my colleagues.
  - In contrast, if someone find critical bugs in live product, it is not a problem of developer who wrote the codes, but the team and process itself.
  - Don't need to blame yourself or your colleagues for the live bugs. Seems hard to stop blaming yourself, but it's the truth. It's not your fault.
  - Better to be more imaginative when writing test cases.
  - "The more the better" for test cases.
