### Variables

- Variables are stored in memory.
- let, var keyword
  - can reassign value
  - always initialized as undefined
  - Q) why not using var keyword anymore?
  - A) since we don't want to use function scope but block scope. var keyword follows function scope so called hoisting.
- const keyword
- mathematical assignment operators
  - += -= \*= /= ++ --
- string concatenation
- string interpolation
  - wrapped by backticks
  - placeholder should be equal to ${varName}
- typeof operator
  - return type of variables

tips)

- don't need to write semicolon at the end of line in javascript
- but recommended to do it
