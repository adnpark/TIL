### Intro to JSX

- JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript
- JSX should be compiled before reaching the web browser
- JSX elements are treated as JavaScript expressions. They can go anywhere that JavaScript expressions can go. ex) variable, function, object, array and etc.
- JSX expression must have exactly one outermost element.
- If you notice that a JSX expression has multiple outer elements, the solution is usually simple: wrap the JSX expression in a <div></div>.
